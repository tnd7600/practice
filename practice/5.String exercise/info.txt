    <==> string.punctuation: This is a predefined constant in the string module that 
    contains all ASCII punctuation characters:- !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

Code <==> new_str = str1.translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))
        =>str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation):

            =>The str.maketrans() method is used to create a translation table.
T           =>he first two arguments are empty strings (""), which means there is 
            no character mapping (we're not replacing characters with other characters).
            =>The third argument is string.punctuation, which means any character     
            found in string.punctuation will be deleted (i.e., removed from the string).
        =>str1.translate(...):

            =>The translate() method applies the translation table created by str.maketrans() 
            to the string str1. It will remove all punctuation characters found in 
            string.punctuation from str1

    any() == function
    code <==> (if any(char.isalpha() for char in word) and any(char.isdigit() for char in word):)
        This condition checks two things for each word:

            =>  any(char.isalpha() for char in word): This part checks if there is at least one 
            alphabetic character in the word (char.isalpha() returns True if the character is
            a letter).
            =>  any(char.isdigit() for char in word): This part checks if there is at least 
            one numeric character in the word (char.isdigit() returns True if the character
            is a number).
